# Day 2
This was a pretty fun day. About five hours spend in a combination of reading, watching, and experimenting. I covered OOP, kwargs/args, nested loops, error handling, string manipulation, and more advanced ifelse chains. Lots of mini projects to reinforce topics. Especially interesting were classes, as I'd seen them before but hadnt actually written. They seem super useful and clean but I'd like to know a bit more about scope within them and what conventions are. The projects were: a calculator, a shopping cart, and finally a racing car simulator built around classes. Looking forward to numpy tomorrow.
